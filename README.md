# Flows Manager

Manager will be the Flows Project administration tool.

Until we arrive at that point it is just an XMPP Disco Browser tool with hints on administration.

Be gentle, this is a project with many firsts for me: Java, Android, XMPP and Git.

## Features

- Navigate JIDs, show its children and features
- Join MUCs with external XMPP client (tested with Conversations and Xabber)
